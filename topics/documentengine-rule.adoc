= Rule



The Rule element is very similar to the Horizontal Rule tag in HTML both in design and purpose. The Rule element is a simple line that spans the width of its parent element with default settings such as solid, black, and 1 pixel wide. Although the Rule element doesn't have to be just a simple line, you can change several properties that can make it a powerful content dividing tool.

The width of the Rule element, by definition, is not how far the line spans horizontally; the line will always span the entire width of its parent container. The width of the Rule element is how thick the line is, so it might be easier to think of the Width property as the element's height (since we normally consider height to be the vertical distance).

You can use the following code to create a page in a section that looks similar to the image above. The following code assumes you already have a  pick:[win-forms=" link:infragistics4.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.report.html[Report]"]   pick:[asp-net=" link:infragistics4.webui.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.report.html[Report]"]   pick:[win-forms-old=" link:infragistics4.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.report.html[Report]"]   pick:[aspnet-old=" link:infragistics4.webui.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.report.html[Report]"]  element defined with at least one  pick:[win-forms=" link:infragistics4.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.section.isection.html[ISection]"]   pick:[asp-net=" link:infragistics4.webui.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.section.isection.html[ISection]"]   pick:[win-forms-old=" link:infragistics4.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.section.isection.html[ISection]"]   pick:[aspnet-old=" link:infragistics4.webui.documents.reports.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.documents.reports.report.section.isection.html[ISection]"]  element added and named section1.
