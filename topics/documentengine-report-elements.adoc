= Report Elements



Use report elements to add content to your report and to lay out that content in a logical flow.

* link:documentengine-report-layout.html[Report Layout] -- Here you'll find several useful elements that control content flow; from the Band element, useful for laying out almost any content, to the Stretcher element, used only to stretch content to the bottom of a page.
* link:documentengine-pattern-content.html[Pattern Content] -- Pattern content is a group of elements that create unique repeatable content such as Grids (row after row), Lists (item after item), and Trees (node after node). You can style each element in this section by using patterns and applying these patterns to the element itself, or individual items in the element for more control over your style patterns.
* link:documentengine-quick-content.html[Quick Content] -- If all you need is a simple content element to quickly insert some content, the quick content elements are right for you.
* link:documentengine-navigation-helpers.html[Navigation Helpers] -- It's difficult to flip through a 500-page report and find what you're looking for without a Table of Contents, Index, or even Bookmarks.
